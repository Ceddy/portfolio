				p 
					| Lyriqal was a project started by @BillLi @Yatchoi and I 
					| in early 2012 to learn Ruby on Rails. 
					| Lyriqal was a social platform for lyrical analysis and interpretation. 
					| We were heavily involved with the project in our spare time and had 
					| fun writing cool (sometimes unecessary) features.
					| The styling was initially done with Twitter bootstrap and we
					| eventually settled upon Zurb foundation because it gave us
					| more flexibility.
